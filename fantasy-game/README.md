School assignment: I had to use Javascript to add functionality to the HTML and CSS that were premade. 
The game: User creates their character, then generates a random enemy to fight. The results are then presented.
The characters are saved in localStorage.

I have also used Jest to test my functions. 
To try the testing, make sure you have Node.js, npm and Jest installed, and write in the terminal:
- npm install
- npm test
